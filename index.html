						<p>When you look up at stars in the night sky, you seeing other stars in the Milky Way. If it really dark, far away from lights from cities and houses, you can even see the dusty bands of the Milky Way stretch across the sky.Some galaxies are spiral-shaped like ours. They have curved arms that make it look like a pinwheel. Other galaxies are smooth and oval shaped. They called elliptical galaxies. And there are also galaxies that aren spirals or ovals. They have irregular shapes and look like blobs. The light that we see from each of these galaxies comes from the stars inside it. </p>

						<p>Earth is our home planet. Scientists believe Earth and its moon formed around the same time as the rest of the solar system. They think that was about 4.5 billion years ago. Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. Its diameter is about 8,000 miles. And Earth is the third-closest planet to the sun. Its average distance from the sun is about 93 million miles. Only Mercury and Venus are closer.Earth is the only planet known to have large amounts of liquid water.
