If it really dark, far away from lights from cities and houses, you can even see the dusty bands of the Milky Way stretch across the sky.Some galaxies are spiral-shaped like ours. They have curved arms that make it look like a pinwheel. Other galaxies are smooth and oval shaped. They called elliptical galaxies. And there are also galaxies that aren spirals or ovals. They have irregular shapes and look like blobs. The light that we see from each of these galaxies comes from the stars inside it.</p><br>
